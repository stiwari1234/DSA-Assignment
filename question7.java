//Sliding Window Technique
//The sliding window technique is a powerful and efficient approach for solving problems on arrays or strings where you need to analyze contiguous subarrays or substrings. The key idea behind this technique is to maintain a "window" (a subset of the array or string) that can be expanded or shrunk dynamically, and you move the window across the data structure.
//
//Basic Concept:
//
//The window is defined by two pointers, often called left and right, which represent the start and end of the window.
//The window slides across the data structure (e.g., a string or an array) by adjusting the position of left and right.
//You expand the window by moving right (i.e., add more elements to the window).
//You shrink the window by moving left (i.e., remove elements from the window).
//The window should be adjusted in a way that it satisfies certain conditions, such as containing only unique characters or having a sum equal to a given value.
